The benefits are a little harder to measure but will nearly always be realized, often with very positive bottom line results. When you or your company are perceived in a more positive light, and when key people feel like they are recognized and appreciated, then goodwill, service, productivity, and loyalty improve. Other benefits may include more sales, lower costs, reduced employee turnover, and higher profitability.</p><p>Even if your intentions are purely altruistic (for example, giving a holiday gift just because “it’s the right thing to do” or because you want to reward your faithful employees), appropriate corporate gifts produce a favorable return on your investment. As a matter of fact, the more unselfish corporate gifts appear to be, the higher your return on investment may become. This type of gift giving will produce its own benefits, not only improving your bottom line but making the business more enjoyable for everyone involved.</p>",

In fact, some of the best corporate gifts have a very small dollar value but generate powerful positive emotions that make them very impactful. For example, the gift of a turkey or ham at Thanksgiving costs just a few dollars, but arouses wonderful nostalgic feelings and memories associated with that traditional American holiday. Few would not be warmed by memories</p><p>of Grandma’s house, the aroma of roast turkey in the kitchen, and being surrounded by beloved family and friends. Other examples of good corporate gifts are turkey or ham for Christmas or Easter, and the traditional gold watch at retirement.

The retiring employee appreciates the gold watch whether or not he actually wears it. The employer has realized much of the benefit regardless of what happens after the point of giving.</p><p>However, you can maximize ROI by giving corporate gifts that will also have recognition value at other points in time, such as the point of use and the points of recollection. This is illustrated by the theoretical model below. The Y-axis shows perceived value. The X-axis shows the passage of time, with points of value recognition indicated. Three examples are shown by the lines representing corporate gifts of a Thanksgiving turkey, a gold watch at retirement, and a cash gift. The area under each line</p>",

Even though it may have a high market value at the point of giving it carries little emotional value and is quickly forgotten as it becomes mingled in the pocketbook with other cash. Most of the time the recipient will not even remember what was purchased, so the cash carries little recollection value. Note: Generic gift certificates and gift cards redeemable for any of a broad range of products are generally perceived the same as cash. The gold watch is appreciated at the time of giving and is fondly remembered for years thereafter. But if the recipient chooses not to wear it there is little value at the point of use.The Thanksgiving turkey has the highest ROI of the three examples of corporate gifts because it carries high emotional value at the point of giving as well as at the point of use and the point of recollection. Recollection value will be especially high if the employee receives the turkey year after year. Note: Gift certificates which can be applied to onlyone type of item (for example, a turkey or ham) are generally perceived the same as the item itself and will produce similar results.<br/><br/></p>",

However, if the dollar value of the gift is relatively low and it is given infrequently it may qualify for the “de minimis benefit”, would be non-taxable to the employee, and would be deductible as a non-wage business expense by the employer. This could include holiday gifts, occasional tickets for entertainment events, and flowers, fruit, books, etc., provided under special circumstances.</p><p>The IRS has ruled that items with a value exceeding $100 could not be considered de minimis, and in some circumstances the dollar limit may be lower. Cash may never be considered a de minimis benefit, nor can gift certificates that are redeemable for any of a significant variety of products. However, gift certificates that can be used only on one type of item are considered tax exempt as de minimis benefits. Please check with your tax attorney for more detailed advice.<br/><br/></p>",
